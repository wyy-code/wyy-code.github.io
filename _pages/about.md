# 👋 Hi there~

I’m a PhD student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), advised by [Prof. Hongxia Yang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~hongxyang/). 

My research focuses on **Model Fusion**—combining multiple trained models from different domains, architectures, or datasets into a single, stronger model to aggregate complementary knowledge and improve performance, generalization, and efficiency. Broadly, I’m interested in LLMs, multimodal learning, and knowledge graphs.

I graduated with my B.S. from the College of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). Then I was recommended to the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology at BUPT, where I am completing my M.S. in Prof. [Jianxin Liao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BB%96%E5%BB%BA%E6%96%B0/8469604)'s group. I was honored to work closely with Prof. Haifeng Sun (BUPT), Prof. Jingyu Wang (BUPT), Dr. Wei Tang (Huawei), and Dr. Yulong Cai (Huawei).

# 🏃 Hobbies
I used to be a member of BUPT’s varsity team and once *ranked 5th* in the amateur division for hammer throw in Beijing (首都高校田径联赛乙组链球第五). Beyond that, I enjoy playing basketball, table tennis, badminton, and muscle building — in fact, I’m passionate about most kinds of sports. These activities not only help me stay healthy and energized, but also bring me a sense of freedom that comes from pushing physical limits and embracing the joy of movement.
